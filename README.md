# About CodTubify ðŸŽµ - An Online Music Player 
CodTubify is a Music Player project, fully developed in Python. It can Play your favorite Songs or any Youtube Playlist without any interruption.

<br />
<br />


## Requirements
* Operation system: **Windows**
* Python Version: **3.9.x**
### Required Modules
* Refer to [`requirements.txt`](src/requirements.txt)
* Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all the Required Modules.
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Required Audio PostProcessors 
* [FFMPEG AND FFPROBE](https://bit.ly/ffmpeg_ffprobe_exe)
( just download the EXE's from the given link and extract them in "src/backend/Download_process/" before starting the application) 
* Or refer to [`IMPORTANT.md`](src/backend/Download_process/important.md)

## The Purpose
The purpose of this project really was to create an application that used a song-name/title or any Youtube URL as an input and downloads a MP3 copy of the desired user input, it then works as a Normal Audio player and basically plays the downloaded Audio, contrary to popular belief of streaming Music instead.

### Technologies
- Python (basically to create everything init)
- Audio PostProcessors (Audio files conversions)
- GitHub (Proejct and Issues)

### Significant Changes
This project required me to utilize many different aspects of what I learned so far in the last 2 Months. I incorporated Modules like yt-dlp and pygame to assist in Downloading Audio Files and Playing them respectively. Instead of traditional Object-oriented way of Programming in tkinter (using CLASSES etc) , i tried to make things as simple as Possible.

### Challenges
- There were significant challenges on this project that had a lot to do with traversing the unknown. Firstly, after i decided NOT to use the Object-oriented Programming approach for the GUI. For a while i was left Confused, because it was not one single gui i was working with, it was a group of many Nested GUI's combined together. though after waiting for someone to answer my questions on stackoverflow (which no one did to this date). I started figuring it out in my Way, Hopefully i was Able to Link all the GUI's with each other. (probably after creating a lot of mess in the code)
- Once i completed the GUI, the second problem which i was encountering was that the audio file downloaded using yt-dlp wasn't really an audio file, so i had to Convert the Downloaded File into a .mp3 using PostProcessors Such as : *FFMPEG/FFPROBE* , so that they become playable with pygame.
- Also if i start listing all the challenges i faced while making it, then probably i would write an entire Nowel here so i'll just keep it short.  

### Things To Consider
I strongly suggest to use VScode or Pycharm or any other Code editor for running the app.py script because i have messed up very much in Directory's and stuff.
(if you DIDN'T understand what i mean :"JUST OPEN THE REPO's FOLDER USING A CODE EDITOR AND THEN RUN THE app.py script ")
